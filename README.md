Fake Review Detector is a machine learning project that detects fake product reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It uses a labeled dataset to train a model that distinguishes between genuine and deceptive reviews. The project leverages TF-IDF for text vectorization and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for prediction. After training, it evaluates performance using classification metrics and saves both the model (model.pkl) and vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl). The project is built in Python with libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, and is structured for easy integration with web applications such as Flask. Future plans include building a user-friendly web interface and experimenting with advanced NLP models like BERT.
